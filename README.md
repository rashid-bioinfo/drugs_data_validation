The adverse effects are categorized by severity into three groups:
- **Severe**
- **Moderate**
- **Mild**

### Severity
Indicates how serious the adverse effect is.
- **Severe:** Potentially life-threatening effects or those requiring immediate medical intervention.
- **Moderate:** Effects that are concerning and may require management, though they are not immediately life-threatening.
- **Mild:** Less serious effects that usually have minimal impact.

### Adverse Effect
The specific side effect or symptom that may occur due to the drug.

### Onset
Describes the timing of when the adverse effect is likely to occur relative to drug administration.
- **Early:** Occurs shortly after taking the drug.
- **Delayed:** Appears some time after drug administration.
- **Rapid:** Occurs almost immediately after administration.

### Incidence
Refers to the frequency or rate at which an adverse effect is observed among patients.
- The values (e.g., "0-4.0") represent percentage ranges indicating the proportion of patients experiencing the effect. For example, "0-4.0" suggests that between 0% and 4% of patients may experience that adverse effect.
- A value shown as "5.3-5.3" indicates a specific, single percentage.
- **"Incidence not known"** means that there is no established data on how frequently the effect occurs.
